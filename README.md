sup,

thank you for clicking on my project

my names adir

i make projects

for school

once u have my project ushud

open it

then

you take the code

you copy the code





once youve copied the code

you paste the code

but when u paste it make sure


that u r using max and that youve selected new from clipboard or something like that, not really sure what its called
havent used that feature in the past two minutes, ive been writing this readme thing


so at the point you should have the code in max

youre probobly wondering what to do. thats becuase you havent finished reading this
once youve finished this, youll know how to use the code thingy that i made for this school project.

so pretty much

at this point

u press the lock button on max. locks are cool

then u take the cursor and u use it. u click the presentation button, it kinda looks like a tv

thanks for using my code
